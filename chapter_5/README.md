The command CD allows the user to change directories.

this will take you all the way out to your first directory.

will take you to that directory provided it is directly below the one that you are in

`$ cd ..`
takes you up one level in the structure.

####Can you CD into the temp directory?

We will if we use the command from the chapter_5 directory

####Can go into the slash temp directory?

`Lauries-MacBook-Pro:tmp $`


####Can you go to the slash temp slash log directory?

####cd to the joe directory with one command. 
to do this, I think we need to be 'above' it by using cd .. twice or cd ../../ then `cd chapter_4/temp/stuff/things/frank/joe/`

####cd back to temp with one command, but not further above that.
`cd ../../../..`

####Find out how to cd to your "home directory" with one command.

`cd` (enter) then `cd documents`

####cd to your Downloads directory, then find it with your file browser.
`cd ..` 
`cd downloads`

####Find another directory with your file browser, then cd to it.
`cd ..` then `cd desktop`

Remember when you put quotes around a directory with spaces in it? You can do that with any command. For example, if you have a directory I Have Fun, then you can do: cd "I Have Fun"
cd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_4/temp/"Life is good"
