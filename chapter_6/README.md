The command ls -lR is long listing format with recursive listing.  This lists more details about the files such as who created it, their role, and the time created.  
There is one more column and I am not sure what it is, maybe the size?

I am not quite sure why this command would be helpful and when I need to use it but I am sure we will learn more about it!
