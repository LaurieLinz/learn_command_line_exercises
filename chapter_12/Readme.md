Less shows the file and we can page through it.  

#### Can we see what's in our production log?
`$ mkdir logs`
`$ cd logs`
`$ echo "production" > production_log.txt`
`less production_log.txt`
    production
    production_log.txt (END)

    



#### What does our database.yml look like?

I do not seem to have a database.yml file.  I suspect that I will have one soon because Google lets me know that this is part of a Rails application.
