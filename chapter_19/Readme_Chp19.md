> What option to ls tells it to output file size in human readable form?

I think you are looking for ls -lh
        
        -h
                When used with the -l option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte,
                Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the
                number of digits to three or less using base 2 for sizes.


>Is there a case insensitive option to grep?
Yes, grep -i

>What does the -r and -f options to rm do exactly?


The -r command is the same as -R and it will remove files and the directories that they are in - will remove everything files and directories.  
The -f command is the force - just do it and don't ask questions about it. 


>What does the ifconfig command do?

This command allows you to configure your network settings by letting you know what devices are running and the IP addresses they have.  There is a lot of other information as well that you may need to know sometime.
