Alternative "english" ways of asking about your environment:

#### What is your shell set to?
SHELL=/bin/bash

#### What directory are you in (don't use pwd this time)?
PWD=/Users/laurielinz/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_21

#### What is your home directory set to?
HOME=/Users/laurielinz

#### Can you set your environment to have DEBUG set to true?
```

Lauries-MacBook-Pro:learn_command_line_exercises $ export DEBUG=true

(master) Laurie Linz
Lauries-MacBook-Pro:learn_command_line_exercises $ echo $DEBUG
true
```


>You can change your path by typing PATH=$PATH:<changes or add a directory here>.  I really do not want to change my path as I am very used to where things are right now.
