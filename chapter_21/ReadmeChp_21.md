#### What is your shell set to?
SHELL=/bin/bash

#### What directory are you in (don't use pwd this time)?
PWD=/Users/laurielinz/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_21

#### What is your home directory set to?
HOME=/Users/laurielinz

#### Can you set your environment to have DEBUG set to true?
I need a little help on this one
