The command hostname tells me the name of the computer that I am currently on.  Since I am working on my laptop this returns Lauries-MacBook-Pro.local.
This is pretty straightforward because I am on my laptop but it could get confusing if you are working remotely.

The command is used like:

`$ hostname`
`(master) Laurie Linz
Lauries-MacBook-Pro:chapter_3 $ hostname
Lauries-MacBook-Pro.local`

If you type it wrong you get:

```(master) Laurie Linz
Lauries-MacBook-Pro:chapter_3 $ hotsname
bash: hotsname: command not found```

I guess hots name is not a thing yet.  :)
