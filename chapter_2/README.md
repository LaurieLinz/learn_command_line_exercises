This chapter covered pwd.  In this case when I type the command pwd I am shown that I am at */Users/laurielinz/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises*
However, this command would state the specific location for which it was typed. Should I want to find this location through finder the process would be to open finder, since we added the DaVinci Coders directory to the favorites all I would need to do would be to click on it. From there I can select the "homework" folder and then the current folder. If I did not have the location set as a favorite I can find my way there through the tree on my user folder: *laurielinz>workspace>davinci_coders_t_1_2016>homework.*
##### 1) What directory are you in?
 `$ pwd`
 ```/Users/laurielinz/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_2```
##### 2) Are you in the class directory?
 `$ pwd` but the folder you are in (not the path) appears at the prompt
 
##### 3) Are you in your home directory? 
 ` $ pwd` if I was this would be the output
 ```/Users/laurielinz```
 

 
##### 4) What directory did you run that command in?
 `$ pwd`  this could be important if you did not receive the expected output
